                <p class="box">2. Next, I extruded into the side of the rectangle by -0.6 inches to carve out space for attaching the wheels, gradually transforming the large rectangle into a model car.</p>

                <p class="box">3. Third, I sketched two identical circles on the same side of the rectangle where I made the previous extrusion. Each circle has a diameter of 1.3 inches and is evenly spaced to enhance the carâ€™s design. I then selected only the upper halves of the circles and extruded them by -0.6 inches, creating the wheel arches for the model car.</p>

                <p class="box">4. Afterwards, I used the sketch tool to draw two identical circles directly beneath the wheel arches with a slightly larger diameter. I used the extrude tool at 0.6 inches to create each of the wheels.</p>

            <div class="image-container">

                <p class="box">5. Following, I used the sketch tool to create a square on the top surface of the car, spaced 0.125 inches away from the front edge. I used the extrude tool at -0.4 inches to create a hole in the center of the car to give space for seats and an interior of the vehicle.</p>

                <p class="box">6. Sixth, I utilized the sketch tool to create a rectangle on the front of the vehicle measuring 0.25 by 0.12 inches. Then, I applied the pattern tool to generate a rectangular pattern across the front, consisting of seven rectangles evenly spaced 0.05 inches apart. Following that, I added a small circle, positioned 0.5 inches from the corner, to serve as the headlight. Finally, I selected all the sketches and extruded them by -0.2 inches.</p>

                <p class="box">7. Up next, I used the sketch tool to create an angled rectangle at the top of the main body to act as a windshield for the vehicle at about a 1 inch height.</p>

                <p class="box">1. First, I began by creating a shape to act as a border and base for my team's logo. I chose a heart because I hope that our project can result in spreading love and happiness to families who have Coffin-Lowry syndrome.</p>

                <p class="box">2. Next, I used the text tool to add text to the center of my logo within the heart. I typed the name of our group, "Nico and His Minions," and selected a visually appealing cursive font, adding a teardrop to the bottom of the heart for aesthetic purposes.</p>

                <p class="box">3. Finally, I used the paint tool to change the color of the heart from white to yellow and selected navy blue for the text, keeping with the Minions theme, resulting in my final team logo.</p>

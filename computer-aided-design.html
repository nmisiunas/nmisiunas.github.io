            <h2 class="box">3D Prototype Design</h2>
            <p class="box">I chose Fusion 360 as the software for designing the prototype because I have developed a high level of proficiency and comfort with it during my time at Belen, even earning a certification in the process. </p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2883.jpg"style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 1">
                <p class="box"> 1. I started my 3D prototype by designing a 5 by 2 inch rectangle and then extruding it to a height of 1.75 inches, resulting in a rectangular prism. This prism would serve as my raw material, allowing me to chisel away unnecessary parts and craft my masterpiece like a sculptor.
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2885.jpg"style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)"alt="Description of image 2">
                <p class="box">2. Next, I extruded into the side of the rectangle by -0.6 inches to carve out space for attaching the wheels, gradually transforming the large rectangle into a model car.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2887.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">3. Third, I sketched two identical circles on the same side of the rectangle where I made the previous extrusion. Each circle has a diameter of 1.3 inches and is evenly spaced to enhance the carâ€™s design. I then selected only the upper halves of the circles and extruded them by -0.6 inches, creating the wheel arches for the model car.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2888.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)"alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">4. Afterwards, I use the sketch tool and draw two identical circles directly beneath the wheel arches with a slightly larger diameter. I use the extrude tool at 0.6 inches to create each of the wheels.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2890.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">5. Following, I used the sketch tool to create a square on the top surface of the car, spaced 0.125 inches away from the front edge. I use the extrude tool at -0.4 inches to create a hole in the center of the car to give space for seats and an interior of the vehicle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2893.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">6. Sixth, I utilized the sketch tool to create a rectangle on the front of the vehicle measuring 0.25 by 0.12 inches. Then, I applied the pattern tool to generate a rectangular pattern across the front, consisting of seven rectangles evenly spaced 0.05 inches apart. Following that, I added a small circle, positioned 0.5 inches from the corner, to serve as the headlight. Finally, I selected all the sketches and extruded them by -0.2 inches. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2901.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">7. Up Next, I used the sktech tool to create an angled rectangle at the top of the main body to act as a windshield for the vehicle at about a 1 inch height.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2902.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">8. Subsequently, I used the extrude tool to bring my sketch to life, at 2 inches, the new extrustion covered the entire front of the vehicle creating a windshield.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2903.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">9. Next, I used the sketch tool to create a rectangle just below the grill of the vehicle to act as the front bumper, and extruded it at 1 inch.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2904.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">10. After, I utilized the fillet tool on the side edge of the hood in order to give it a more rouded off look rather than a blocky feel.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2909.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">11. Following, I used the sketch tool on the faces of the wheels and created small circles with a diameter of 0.2 inches. Thereafter, I used the circular pattern tool to create a pattern across the wheel and then extruded them by -0.2 inches giving the rims a more realistic look. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2911.jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">12. After all, I selected the entire project with the reflection tool then selected the inner wall as my surface of reflection.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/IMG_2912_(1).jpg" style="border:10px solid rgb(255, 145, 222)" alt="Description of image 3">
                <p class="box">13. In conclusion, after all the steps, you end up with a rough prototype of what we envision our project to appear like. A jeep-like remote control vehicle that allows Jorge to roam freely and safely in his backyard under his fathers control and supervision.</p>

            <h2 class="box">2D Logo Design Process</h2>
            <p class="box"> I selected Affinity Design 2 to create my team logo due to its accessibility on the iPad, which allows for a seamless user experience. Additionally, the software is intuitive and easy to learn, making it an excellent choice for my design needs.</p>

                <p class="box">1. First, I began by creating a shape to act as a border and base for my teams logo. I chose a heart, because I hope that our project can result in spreading love and happiness to families who hav coffin-lowry syndrome.</p>

                <p class="box">2. Next I used the text tool and added text to the center of my logo within the heart. Then i typed into the text box, the name of our group, Nico and His Minions. I selected the text and changed the font to a move visually appealing cursive font and added a tear drop to the bottom of the heart for aesthetic purposes./p>

                <p class="box">3. Finally, I used the paint tool the change the color of the heart from white to yellow, and selcted the text and changed it to navy blue, keeping with the minions theme, resulting in my final team logo.</p>

            <p>Certainly! Here's a brief paragraph for your engineering portfolio:

                ---
                
                I’m a dedicated student at Belen Jesuit Preparatory, where I’m actively pursuing a dual focus in engineering and accounting. My passion for problem-solving extends beyond the classroom, as I also thrive on the basketball court and lacrosse field, balancing athletic pursuits with academic excellence. My diverse interests and experiences fuel my commitment to innovation and precision, driving me to excel in both engineering and accounting disciplines.
